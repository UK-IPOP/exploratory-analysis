# Exploratory Analysis
This repository is linked to a DeepNote project for preliminary and exploratory analysis in a notebook environment for R, Python, or Julia. 
Datafiles are kept seperately in the DeepNote environment for security reasons.

This repository serves two main purposes:
1. Exploration of new datasets, data science methods, and packages
2. One-off analyses such as the countries_in_titles analysis. If these occur more than once they should be moved to their own repository.

Features:
- DeepNote Integration
-
