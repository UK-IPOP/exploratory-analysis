# Exploratory Analysis

This repository is for preliminary and exploratory analysis in a notebook environment for R, Python, or Julia.
Data-files are kept separately for security reasons.

This repository serves two main purposes:

1. Exploration of new datasets, data science methods, and packages
2. One-off analyses such as the countries_in_titles analysis. If these occur more than once they should be moved to their own repository.
